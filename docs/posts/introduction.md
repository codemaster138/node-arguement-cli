## Motivation
There are many, many, probably too many CLI argument parsers out there, but each one of them lacks *something* – whether that's fancy looks or configurability, or whether it just does a bit too much/little *magic*, varies. None of them is perfect.

For example, [yargs](https://npmjs.com/packages/yargs)' subcommand system is, quite honestly, not that good, and the black-and-white UI leaves room for improvement.

**Tauris** is my personal take on what a CLI argument parser/CLI tool should be like.
